# PDFSummarizing

PDFSummarizer is a desktop application that uses technologies such as LangChain to summarize and consult documents in PDF format. Its main objective is to satisfy the needs of users who seek to efficiently obtain the essential content of a document, taking advantage of advanced linguistic synthesis capabilities. In addition, the application was developed to facilitate the formulation and execution of queries, providing an intuitive interface to solve specific questions about the content of PDF files. This advanced technical approach guarantees an ideal experience for users with specific document analysis requirements.

This project is mainly inserted in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), once the use of technologies such as LangChain suggests the integration of advanced language processing capabilities based on machine learning algorithms and models.
